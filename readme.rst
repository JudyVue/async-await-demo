``async``/``await`` demos for SJSW
----------------------------------

This repo is a starting point for a demo talk scheduled on March 22, 2017. It's intended to demonstrated ``async`` and ``await`` features, which are rolling out now in evergreen browsers. To avoid having to resize and mess around with dev tools, the code exposes an in-page log panel and we can always add more stuff to it.

The AMD-esque loader used for this project's module system is built around promises and async functions, and so it provides a handy way of demonstrating their use in a fun, useful way. `See this gist <https://gist.github.com/thomaswilburn/64e28c5d894acc92ad24541f9fbf7bf2>`_ for more information.
